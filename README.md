# Substances Chatbot
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Introduction
This runbook guides you through setting up and running the 'Substances_Chatbot_LB.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook project, which is a short project utilizing a chatbot that provides information about substances using data from Wikipedia.

### Prerequisites
Before running the chatbot, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. Python 3: You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps to Run the Chatbot

1. **Download the Notebook**:
   - Download the 'Substances_Chatbot_LB.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook file to your local machine.

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Open a command prompt or terminal window.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the notebook file.
   - Run the following command to install the necessary library if you haven't already:
     ```
     pip install wikipedia-api
     ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open a command prompt or terminal window.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the 'Substances_Chatbot_LB.ipynb' file.
   - Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.

4. **Run the Notebook**:
   - In the Jupyter Notebook interface, locate and click on 'Substances_Chatbot_LB.ipynb' to open it.
   - In the notebook, you will see code cells. You can run each cell by selecting it and clicking the "Run" button in the Jupyter Notebook toolbar. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut (usually Shift+Enter) to execute the cells one by one.
   - Start by running the cells from the top, which contain the code for the chatbot.

5. **Interact with the Chatbot**:
   - Once you have run the code cells containing the chatbot functions, you will see the chatbot's prompt: "What substance would you like information about? (Enter 'exit' to end the chat)".
   - You can interact with the chatbot by typing your questions about substances.
   - To exit the chat, type 'exit', 'quit', or 'bye'.

6. **View Chatbot Responses**:
   - The chatbot will provide information about the substances you inquire about using data from Wikipedia.
   - Information will be displayed regarding usage, dosage, and side effects of the substance if available.

7. **Exit the Chatbot**:
   - To exit the chatbot, type 'exit', 'quit', or 'bye' as mentioned earlier.
   - The chatbot will respond with "Goodbye!" and the chat session will end.

8. **Note**:
   - If the chatbot encounters any issues or cannot find information about a substance, it will inform you accordingly.
